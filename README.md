To start of, I choose to design my website's overall color theme (including the fonts), using a mix of semi-dark red, black and white. With those mix of colors, my personal portfolio website will not look plain and boring. Instead it will look much more visually appealing and modernised. I have also implemented styles to the scroll-bar on the website, so as to make it unique and fresh instead of using the default scroll-bar. From the "Home" Page of my website, it consists of the main title of the website namely "My Personal Portfolio". There is also a navigation menu which aids the users to navigate through my website with convenience. Not only that, but the navigation menu's display will also adapt to suit mobile users, making it an overall user-friendly website for all my users. The final highlights of the "Home" Page would be the typing back and forth animated text which loops continously that displays my name and where I am from to the users.  Moving on, we have the "About Me" Page, which is a introduction of myself to the users, allowing them to get to know about me more. 

The next page would be "My Education", which as the name suggests, displays my education's history timeline since Secondary. I used black as the background together with an animated semi-dark red highlight (when users hover over the respective contents), so as to allow the users to be able to see the main highlights of my portfolio easier. This can be said the same for both "My Skills" and "My Awards" Pages. Next, "My Skills' Page's content is to get the users to know more about my talents that I am experienced in, which also includes my working experiences (ITE Internship). "My Awards" Page main purpose is to showcase my achievements to the users, that I have achieved over the years in my education journey. Next, I created the "Contact Me" Page, which is essential for a portfolio website since the purpose of my website is ensure that I will be hired from the recruiters. The page displays important contents such as my name, contact number and email address. There is also a simple contact form that allows the users/recruiters to fill up the required fields which involves input validation. With that, users/recruiters will then be able to contact me if they are interested. To end of, I have created the "Footer Section" that enables users to go to any of my social media profiles by clicking on the respective platform icons.

## Design Process
For my ID Assignment 1, I decided to go with "Project Example Idea 2", which tasks me to build/create a personal portfolio website specifically for myself. Since one of the main goals of having a personal portfolio website is mainly for recruiters to hire me as an applicant, I must present my portfolio website with visually appealing visuals and contents about me. Furthermore, the website must also be optimized for mobile-users. Therefore, I will then have a higher chance of getting hired from the recruiters who viewed my website.
While I was brainstorming ideas, I tried to look from the perspective of the users/recruiters who are using my website, such as:

**User Stories**
- As a user/recruiter, I want to know about the purpose of this website clearly with no confusion.
- As a user/recruiter, I would want to contact the creater of this website using the contact form from the "Contact Me" Page.
- As a user/recruiter, I would want to be able to navigate through the website with ease.
- As a user/recruiter, I would like the contents of the website to be intelligible with no difficulty in reading.
- As a user/recruiter, I would want the website to be compatible for all devices. (e.g Mobile-Friendly).
